                    <h2>This is my Arduino Project</h2>
                    <p> The project consisted of connecting a 4x4 keyboard matrix
                    to an Arduino Uno board. The lcd from the previous project was then taken and it's code was rewritten
                    to be able to receive data and display the incoming information onto the lcd. Several libraries were installed and configure
                    to handle the functions of the keyboard and lcd. The end product is able to read the keys pressed from A to * and display them on the lcd accordingly.

            <h2> Biggest Takeaways</h2>
            <p> When I was going through my Arduino Project there were several
                big takeaways that I'm sure will dictate my success as an engineer.
                One, it is very important to fully dive into a subject, it all takes one step at a time. Initially, the project seemed easy to me, I was going to type
                a few lines of code, watch an arduino beep, and let the circuit board do its thing. These things
                seemed simple to me at the time, but it took a good amount of time and a greater amount of effort to figure out what I had to do . 
                It turns out there's a lot more to it than just following a picture. I started to dive
                into the world of circuts, C++, CSS, Java to HTML, electronic setup, pin-declaration, conversion documents, configuring libraries, finding out some of classes don't work with my operating system so I have to restart all over, 
                learn exactly what the world of programming is an then come back to solve the issue, learn how to handle problems on your own, and finally how to create solutions on your own.
                Through this experience I learned that engineers are true master problem-solvers and the consistent problem-solving one goes through also translates to other parts of life as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm appreciatiative of this experience and I do hope I can have more connections in the future.
