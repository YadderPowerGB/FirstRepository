            <h2> Biggest Takeaways</h2>
            <p> When I was going through my Arduino Project there were several
                big takeaways that I'm sure will dictate my everlasting success as an engineer.
                One, it is very important to fully dive into a subject that will fit your needs and what
                you want to do in life. Initially, the project seemed easy to me, I was going to type
                a few lines of code, learn what an arduino does, and how a circut board works. These things
                seemed so simple to me at the time, but boy was I in for a whole new world. I started to dive
                into the world of circuts, C++, CSS, Java-to-HTML/C++ conversion documents, configuring libraries in proportion to
                electronic setup, pin-declaration, and much much more. Through this experience I learned that I want to dive into the
                world of electronics and software. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm very appreciatiative of this experience and I do hope I can have more connections in the future.
